<h1>new generation</h1>
<p>To create a link that starts up 
    the user's email program and 
    addresses an email to a specified 
    email address, you use the <a>
    element. However, this time the <br />
    value of the href attribute starts 
    with mailto: and is followed by <br />
    the email address you want the 
    email to be sent to.
    On the right you can see that 
    an email link looks just like any 
    other link but, when it is clicked <br />
    on, the user's email program 
    will open a new email message 
    and address it to the person 
    specified in the link</p>


    <h1>our problems</h1>
    <p>If you want a link to open in a 
        new window, you can use the 
        target attribute on the opening<br /> 
        <a> tag. The value of this 
        attribute should be _blank.
        One of the most common 
        reasons a web page author <br />
        might want a link to be opened 
        in a new window is if it points to 
        another website. In such cases, <br />
        they hope the user will return 
        to the window containing their 
        site after finishing looking at the <br />
        other one.
        Generally you should avoid 
        opening links in a new window, 
        but if you do, it is considered <br />
        good practice to inform users 
        that the link will open a new 
        window before they click on it.</p>
